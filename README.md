# react-typescript-monorepo-boilerplate
_Too tired to create all web projects from scratch again and again_

Unless you have a project that is going to be heavily dependent upon some framework (for example, you might be using Next.js), it's always the best practice NOT to use create-react-app to leave 100% of room for custom configurations. This is just the template repository for that.

The configs include the basic things I use for any of my projects. They're opinionated.
